# Setting the standard
The team is to agree on a standard for how we document and design architectural diagrams.
- What is the current level expectation of
- How do we provide
that tell the narrative for different stakeholders?
- How do we ensure documentation and diagrams are dynamic/flexible?
- How do we ensure visual consistency?
- Does the chosen approach fit the team's vision, goal, and objectives?
- How do we move fast as a team?
- How do we communicate quickly and well?
Considerations :
- [Diagram considerations ]https://c4model.com/review/) - Does this approach fit the objective?
# What is the C4 Model?
The C4 Model is an "abstraction-first" approach to diagramming software architecture
C4 stands for:
1. Context
2. Containers
3. Components
4. Code
**NOTE :**
_The definition of containers has no relationship to Docker-_
# C4 Model breakdown
## Content / System Context (Level 1)
System Content is the system mapping plus user and system dependencies at a high level.
When drawing a system context diagram we need to be thinking or asking "Who's using it?" Is it a particular Role or User(s), assess the persona(5). Then we are able to map the user alongside nonspecific technology systems.

## Containers (Level 2)
The container level is the overall shade of the architecture and chosen technologies.
